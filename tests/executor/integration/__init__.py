"""Integration tests for ExecutorGraph with different project types.

Phase 6.2: Integration Tests

These tests verify end-to-end execution of the executor graph with
different project types: Python, Node.js, Rust, and monorepos.

Tests are marked with @pytest.mark.integration and require actual
LLM API access to run. They are skipped by default in CI.
